# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-21

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Markdown-flashcards** ("we," "our," or "us"). We believe that your writing belongs to you. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application hosted at **[https://tbuserdev.github.io/markdown-flashcards/](https://tbuserdev.github.io/markdown-flashcards/)**.

Our core philosophy is simple: **We do not want your data.**

## 2. Local Data Storage

**Markdown-flashcards** is a fully local ("offline-first") application.

*   **Your Content:** All Markdown files, notes, and text you create or edit within the application are stored exclusively on your device (e.g., within your browser's Local Storage or your device's file system).
*   **No Cloud Uploads:** We do not have a backend server. We do not transmit, process, or store your content on our servers or any third-party cloud servers.
*   **Data Control:** Since your data is stored locally, you are solely responsible for backing up your data. If you clear your browser cache or delete the application data, your content may be lost.

## 3. Analytics

To understand how many people use our application and which pages are most popular, we use **[Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/en)**.

*   **Privacy-First:** Simple Analytics is a privacy-friendly alternative to tools like Google Analytics.
*   **No Cookies:** Simple Analytics does not use cookies, local storage, or persistent identifiers.
*   **No PII:** We do not collect or store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your IP address.
*   **Compliance:** Simple Analytics is GDPR, CCPA, and PECR compliant.

You can learn more about their data practices here: [Simple Analytics Privacy Policy](https://simpleanalytics.com/privacy).

## 4. Hosting and Infrastructure

This website is hosted on **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**.

*   **Server Logs:** Because the application is hosted on GitHub, GitHub (owned by Microsoft) may collect technical logs (such as your IP address and User Agent) for security and reliability purposes when you load the website.
*   **GitHub's Policy:** We do not have access to these logs. For more information on how GitHub handles data, please refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## 5. Cookies

Aside from the technical infrastructure required to host the site (via GitHub Pages), this application **does not use cookies**.
