# Markdown Flashcards Ecosystem

Welcome to the documentation for the **Markdown Flashcards Ecosystem**. This project consists of two main tools designed to help you learn more efficiently using the power of AI and Flashcards.

## The Tools

### 1. NotebookLM Extractor
A browser extension that allows you to extract quizzes and flashcards generated by Google's NotebookLM. You can save them as Markdown files or directly export them to GitHub Gists.

### 2. Markdown Flashcards
A web-based flashcard trainer that loads decks from Markdown files. It's perfect for studying the content you extracted from NotebookLM or wrote yourself.

## How they work together

1.  **Generate**: Use NotebookLM to generate a quiz or flashcards from your documents.
2.  **Extract**: Use the **NotebookLM Extractor** extension to grab that data.
3.  **Host**: Save it as a **GitHub Gist** (using the extension) or a Markdown file.
4.  **Study**: Load the Gist URL or file into the **Markdown Flashcards** app to start learning.
