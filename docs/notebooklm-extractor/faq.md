# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this extension safe?
Yes. The code runs entirely locally on your browser. It only communicates with GitHub (if you use the Gist feature) and never sends your data to any third-party servers.

### Why do I need to install it in "Developer Mode"?
Currently, this is a personal project and not listed on the Chrome Web Store. "Developer Mode" is the standard way to use extensions that you build yourself or download from GitHub.

### Can I use it with other browsers?
It is built for Chrome-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi). It might work on Firefox with some adjustments, but it is not officially supported.

### My export is empty. Why?
Ensure that the quiz or flashcard section is **visible** on your screen in NotebookLM before you click "Extract". The extension reads the data currently displayed on the page.

### How do I update the extension?
If you download a new version of the code:
1.  Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2.  Find "NotebookLM Extractor".
3.  Click the **Reload** (circular arrow) icon.
