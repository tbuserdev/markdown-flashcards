# Introduction

**NotebookLM Extractor** is a browser extension designed to bridge the gap between Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) and your study routine.

NotebookLM is fantastic at analyzing documents and generating quizzes or flashcards. However, getting that data *out* of NotebookLM and into a dedicated study tool can be tedious.

**NotebookLM Extractor solves this by allowing you to:**

*   **One-Click Extract**: Grab the currently visible quiz or flashcards from NotebookLM.
*   **Format for Study**: Automatically format the data into standard Markdown (compatible with Obsidian, Mochi, and our Flashcard App).
*   **Export Anywhere**: Download as a file or save directly to a GitHub Gist for instant sharing.

## Why use it?

*   **Save Time**: No more copy-pasting questions and answers one by one.
*   **Own Your Data**: Keep your study materials in open formats like Markdown.
*   **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work perfectly with the [Markdown Flashcards App](/markdown-flashcards/introduction).
