# Usage Guide

## Loading Flashcards

There are two ways to get flashcards into the app:

### 1. Preload via URL (Recommended)
The easiest way to share or load a deck is by adding a `?preload=` parameter to the app's URL.

Example:
`https://tbuserdev.github.io/markdown-flashcards/?preload=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/...`

When you open this link, the app will automatically ask if you want to import the deck.

### 2. Manual Import
1.  Click the **Add New** button in the top bar.
2.  Paste the URL of your Markdown file (e.g., a GitHub Raw URL).
3.  Give the deck a name.
4.  Start studying!

## Studying

Once a deck is loaded, you will see the first question.

1.  **Read the Question**: Try to recall the answer.
2.  **Show Answer**: Press `Spacebar` or click "Show Answer".
3.  **Rate Yourself**: How well did you know it?
    *   **Hard (1)**: I didn't know it / got it wrong.
    *   **Medium (2)**: I recalled it, but it took effort.
    *   **Easy (3)**: I knew it instantly.

### Navigation
*   **Next Card**: `Right Arrow` or Click "→"
*   **Previous Card**: `Left Arrow` or Click "←"

## Filtering
Use the buttons at the top to filter your view:
*   **All**: Show every card in the deck.
*   **Remaining**: Show cards you haven't rated yet (or reset).
*   **Hard/Medium/Easy**: Review only specific categories.
