# Introduction

**Markdown Flashcards** is a simple, no-nonsense web application for studying flashcards.

Unlike other apps that require complex accounts, databases, or proprietary formats, this app runs entirely in your browser and uses **Markdown files** as decks.

## Key Features

*   **Simple Format**: Write your cards in plain text.
*   **No Login Required**: Just open the URL and start studying.
*   **Spaced Repetition-ish**: Sort cards into "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard" to focus on what you don't know.
*   **Rich Content**: Support for code blocks, images, tables, and lists (thanks to Markdown).
*   **Import from Anywhere**: Load decks from GitHub, Gists, or any public URL.

## The "Mochi" Format
We use the popular "Mochi Cards" markdown flavor. It's incredibly simple:

```markdown
Question
---
Answer
```

That's it! Three dashes separate the front from the back. A blank line separates cards.
