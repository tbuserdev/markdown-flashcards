# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is my data saved?
All your decks and progress are saved in your **browser's Local Storage**. This means if you clear your browser cache, your progress will be lost. We recommend keeping your source Markdown files (e.g., in Gists) safe as a backup.

### Can I use images?
Yes! Since it uses standard Markdown, you can include images like this:
`![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.png)`
*Note: The image URL must be publicly accessible.*

### Can I write code?
Absolutely. Code blocks work perfectly:
```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

### How do I delete a deck?
Select the deck you want to remove from the dropdown menu, then click the **Delete** button in the top bar.

### Can I edit cards in the app?
Currently, no. The app is a "player" or "viewer". To edit cards, you should edit your source Markdown file and then re-import it (choose "Replace" when prompted).
